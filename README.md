BattleToys
===========
BattleToys is a mini game (and tech demo) that uses the Oculus Rift and
the Myo armband to fight evil sock animals in a twisted child's bedroom.

BattleToys is based on an existing game designed by Unity for tutorial
purposes. The tutorial game, "Survival Shooter", is a game designed in
2014 to teach potential Unity users how to design games in the Unity
engine. We adapted this game and added enhanced Oculus Rift support,
added our own hammer weapon, and added the Myo armband support to control
our weapon!
